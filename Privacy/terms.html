    <h1>Terms and Conditions for My TikTok Data Exporter</h1>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>My TikTok Data Exporter</strong> (the "App"). This document outlines the terms and conditions governing your use of this App. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction to the App</h2>
    <p>My TikTok Data Exporter is a tool designed to help you, the individual user, export and manage your own personal TikTok user data for analytical purposes. It provides a means to access your TikTok profile information and video metadata for your private use.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to collect specific information directly from your TikTok account, <strong>only with your explicit authorization</strong> via the TikTok API. The information collected is limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your own TikTok user data:</strong> This includes profile information such as your username, profile picture URL, and other public details associated with your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Your own TikTok video metadata:</strong> This includes details about your videos such as video titles, descriptions, creation dates, view counts, likes, comments, and share counts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The App does not collect any data from other TikTok users or any information beyond what is necessary for its stated purpose of exporting your own data.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The sole purpose for collecting your TikTok user and video data is to process and present it to you for your personal analysis. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data is used to display your TikTok video performance, typically by exporting it to a Google Sheet or similar format for your personal review and analysis.</li>
        <li>All processing of your data is for your individual, private, and non-commercial use only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not share any of the information collected by this App with any third parties.</strong> Your data remains confidential and is processed exclusively for your designated personal use as outlined in these terms. The App is not designed to distribute, sell, or otherwise make your data available to anyone else.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>This App, being primarily a server-side script (e.g., running within a Google Apps Script environment), does not utilize cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities, personal data, or interactions with the App itself.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services (TikTok Integration)</h2>
    <p>This App integrates directly with the TikTok platform via its official API. Your use of TikTok, your TikTok account, and any data accessed through this App are also subject to TikTok's own policies. We strongly advise you to review:</p>
    <ul>
